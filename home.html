			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Gonzaga University's electronic reappointment, promotion, and tenure software application. This goal of this website is
			to assist applicants and evaluators with the RPT process by simplifying binder creation and eliminating paper waste.  This
			website was designed by a group of senior computer science students as part of their capstone project for the year of 2015-16, 
			with hopes to assist Gonzaga University in bettering the RPT process.</p>
			<p>Essentially, users of the eRPT system are broken up into three different user roles. If you are are currently logged on to the 
			web application, you are either an Applicant, Organizer or Evaluator. In some case, members of Gonzaga's faculty would or could be
			in the role of multiple user types at the same time. For instance, you may be submitting your own application for reappointment while
			also serving as a committee member on other's current open applications. </p>
			<p>Most users of the Gonzaga Electronic Reappointment Promotion and Tenure system are going to be applicants. In this role,
			you can create a binder that will be submitted to various committees for evaluation. To do this, select the "My Binder" tab at the top of
			the page. From here, you will be able to start a new binder for submission, and view previous binder you have made.</p>
			<p>Organizers and Evaluators can select on the tabs of the same name respectively. As an Organizer, you can add files to binders that have been
			submitted for additional materials, or as an Evaluator, you can view completed binders that are ready for review by your committee.</p>
