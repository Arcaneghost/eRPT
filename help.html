			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Learning any new web application can be tricky, the goal of this page is to make the transition as seamless as possible for new users.
			Below you will find various documentation on how to create a binder, add files to your binder, submit a binder for review as well as other functionalities. 
			Depending on what type of user you are (Applicant, Evaluator or Organizer) the various sections will be very helpful.</p>
			<hr>

			<h2>Creating a Binder</h2>
			<p>In order to create a binder, please click on the My Binder tab at the top of the page. 
			You can also do this by clicking <button onclick="myBinderRedirect()">Here</button>
			Once this is done, you will be able to create a new binder, or select from previous binders you have created in past years. 
			If you are starting a new binder, you can open up the side bar to add various new files to you binder. Note, that currently
			all files added to the binder must be in a .pdf format. Click on Add File to select a file on your computer to add a pdf
			to a section of the binder. Here, in the sidebar dropdown menu, you can edit or delete pdf's from this section of your binder.
			Once, your binder is complete you can submit it. Once a binder is submitted, the binder cannot be changed or edited.
			<hr>

			<h2>Organizing a Binder</h2>
			<p>If you are accessing the site as an Organizer you can select various binders that have been submitted 
			<button onclick="workbenchRedirect()">Here</button> You can also navigate to the proper page via the tabs above, and selecting 'Organizer'. 
			These binders represented submitted faculty binders that are ready to passed on
			to the proper evaluators within the eRPT site. If there is a binder that you are expecting to be there but is not, it is
			possible that the binder has not yet been submitted for evaluation by the faculty member who it belongs to. Once a binder is in viewing
			from the Applicant, you will be able to add supplemental material to the binder. Current files placed in the binder will be viewable to
			you as an Organizer. You cannot deleted files submitted by the Applicant, but will be able to add additional materials. Once, the binder
			you are organizing is ready to be evaluated, you can select submit, to a particular committee that will review this binder for
			reappointment, promotion or tenure.Once a binder is submitted, the binder cannot be changed or edited.</p>
			<hr>

			<h2>Evaluating a Binder</h2>
			<p>If you are accessing the site as an Evaluator you can select various binders that are available for evaluation
			<button onclick="evaluationRedirect()">Here</button> You can also navigate to the proper page via the tabs above by selecting Evaluate. 
			These binders represented submitted faculty binders that are ready to evaluated for various positions. 
			If there is a binder that you are expecting to be there but is not, it is
			possible that the binder has not yet been submitted for evaluation by the faculty member who it belongs to, or an Organizer
			has not yet passed it on the all the Evaluators that will be viewing the binder. Once a binder has been submitted to a particular
			committee by the Organizer, it will be viewable to you, if you are a designated Evaluator in the eRPT process. You may then add annotations
			to a binder that is view format, comments will then be saved for later viewing only by the original Evaluator who created them. When a
			recommendation is reached by the committee, the binder's confidential material is permanent deleted from the web application.</p>
